# Changes: CRITICAL FIX - Removed blocking infinite loop in webhook mode that was causing premature shutdown
# - Modified telegram_handler.py to not run blocking loop in webhook mode
# - Enhanced webhook handler with detailed logging
# - Fixed main.py to await bot initialization instead of creating background task
# This should resolve the Gunicorn TERM signal and premature shutdown issue
